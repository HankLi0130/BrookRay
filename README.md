## Setting up the dependency

1. Add it in your root `build.gradle` at the end of repositories:

```

allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

```

2. Add the dependency in your app `build.gradle`

```

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.hankli0130:brookray:Tag'
}

```

That's it !
